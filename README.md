# GettingAndCleaningData

This is the Getting and cleaning data course project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This repo contains a few items as described below.

* A tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* The R script used to generate the tidy data set.
* A code book that describes the variables, data, and any transformations or work that has performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
