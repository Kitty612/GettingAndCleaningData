# Getting and Cleaning data course project

## The data

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The data was obtained from this site: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones



## The variables

* subjectID: the ID of the test subject
* activityID: the ID of the type of activity


## Data set munipulation

* Merge the training set and test set to create one data set
* Extract only the mean and standard deviation columns for each measurement
* Change activity names in the data set to descriptive activity names using activityLabels table
* Clean up the data labels with more descriptive column names
* Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
